<summary>What is a giftmoot economy?</summary>
A giftmoot economy is an economic system based on the primary activity of gift-giving resources rather than exchanging resources. This gift-giving is coordinated by a network of voluntary, private democratic associations called giftmoots.

Gifts are voluntary, [one-way, non-reciprocal transfer of resources](index.md), where one party gives another party a gift with no obligation or expectation to provide something in return. This differs from an exchange where a transfer of resources creates an obligation to provide something of somewhat equivalent value in return.

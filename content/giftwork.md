# Why would people work in a giftmoot economy?

The motivations for work are many and varied.  In an exchange economy, where one’s ability to have resources allocated to them comes from their exchange capicty, a primary motivation to work is ensure their own survival.  One outcome of this is high work participation, including in relatively unpalatable or unexciting jobs.  However, this also means that some jobs are only attended to because otherwise a person’s survival would be threatened.

Not everyone works just for money and survival, however.  Many people take lower-paying jobs tha they find more personally rewarding than higher paying jobs, and many people volunteer when they could otherwise be at leisure.  There are motivations to work that are not based on survival or money.  Here are some examples:

*General exchange*

Modern society is a very beneficial place for people to live - it has comfort, entertainment, quality healthcare.  People rely on and enjoy being part of a healthy society that can offer up these benefits.  But these benefits are only available if society continues to function.  To this end, many people are motivated to work because they want to maintain the society that they live in - their job helps sustain doctors that keep them alive, farmers who grow their food, and the entertainers that make their favourite television programs.

While non-reciprocal gifting is incompatible with an individual or specific exchange, this is an example of a *general exchange* or *diffuse reciprocity*, where one party contributes resources and expects something in return, but which isn’t an immediate, specific and obligatory return.

*Moral concern and care*

Many people also take work because they are motivated by moral concern or care, such as looking after others, implementing justice, or helping people in situations of disadvantage.  Even in the current exchange economy it is clear that there are numerous volunteers in firefighting, emergency services, medicine, food provision, and much more where people volunteer their times and resources.

*Self-actualisation*

Sometimes a job is just a job, but at other times the job itself is interesting and engaging.  Jobs can connect people with ideas and activities that they enjoy, can help people improve their skills, can make them feel productive, or can help them feel accomplished.  People who love animals might wish to work with animals, or people who like solving problems might help engineer new technology.  Jobs can give people purpose and meaning.

*Community*

Jobs also get people engaging with other people, whether they are coworkers or customers or wider community members.  Jobs can stop people from feeling isolated, and can be the source of friendships, romances, and families.

*Careers*

There are plenty of jobs that people are attracted to, but which might be competitive.  Some jobs would be stepping stones to these other jobs - a way to prove that someone is a hard-worker, reliable and has the right skills.  So it’s possible that people would take less attractive jobs in order to build their resume and move towards the jobs that they genuinely desire.

*Pro-system sentiment*

There are many advocates for the current economic system, but there are also those who feel that it is oppressive and exploitative.  These people are demotivated to work because the work can seem purposeless or unrewarding, or where the rewards are primarily going to someone else.  People don’t want to work for “the man”.  This is a type of anti-system sentiment.

In a system where jobs are voluntary - that is, where the resources to survive would be gifted to someone whether they work or not - people will have a much greater ability to choose what sort of work they want to participate in, rather than feeling forced into a job they find meaningless in order to survive.  And a worker could leave a job if the conditios were poor - unsafe, unfair, uncomfortable.  Work would take on a less exploitative and oppressive connotation.  Workers would generally only work in jobs that they felt were genuinely contributing to society.  Moreover, without money employers could not easily accrue abstract wealth, reducing the sense that a worker’s rewards are really going to their boss.

Overall, this should produce a more pro-system sentiment, where work is seen in a positive light about contributing to society and reliant on the worker, rather than the worker feeling pressured into roles they find uncomfortable or even immoral just to survive.

# Signalling, under-signalling and signal inversion

## Value - exchange, cost, use

One way to consider economic motivations and behaviour is to consider the exchange-value, cost-value and use-value of a good.

The use-value is what a user would get out of the good, while the cost-value is the time, effort and materials that go into it.  The exchange-value is how exchangeable the good is, which varies depending on people being willing and able to pay the price.

There is no way to objectively convert between or compare these values.  A person making a comparison would need to use some subjective unit of value, but this would vary by person and context.

In a world without exchanges, a good would be made if socially overall *use>cost*, and not made if *cost>use*.  Something that is necessary and possible might be made even though the cost is high, while something unnecessary might only be made if the cost were low.

In a world with exchanges, the picture is more complicated.  Consider

*Use>exchange>cost*

In this case, the good would be made, because the producers will gain revenue from it, and the user will pay to obtain the item.  In constrast:

*Use>cost>exchange*

…might result in the item not being made, because although the use is more valuable than the cost, the good wuld not be distributed unless the exchange requirements were reached.  The reason exchange requirements might not be reached could be that the people who value the use don’t have the exchange capacity to pay for more than the cost.  This would be an example of under-signalling.

Conversely, consider:

*Exchange>use>cost*

In this circumstance the item would be made, but it might be held on to by speculators rather than go to the people who value its use.  This would occur when the future use-value or exchange-value is speculated to be higher than the current value, such as housing.  This is a type of signal inversion.  When the expected future value falls below the use-value (back to the more “natural” use>exchange>cost) then there is a signal reversion.

Note that on an individual actor basis this is not problematic, because it means people will make things they do not themselves value in order to sell them.  Signal inversion only occurs on a social level, where many actors treat a good in such a manner and affect the cost.  When this happens they can price users out of the market.

Finally, there is:

*Exchange>cost>use*

These are mostly financial instruments - often they have no inherent use but instead are mechanisms to convert exchangeability.  Bitcoin is one where the cost is significantly higher than the use value.

The exchange economy attempts to coordinate resource allocation via the use of exchanges and therefore money, but the added complication of having an exchange-value actually presents circumstances where necessary goods might not be allocated.  A non-reciprocal gifting economy economy would avoid these two issues of under-signalling and signal inversion.

## Individual evaluation

In a non-reciprocal gifting economy, an individual actor hoarding a good they themselves would not use would result in *cost>use*, where the good costs more to store than it provides in benefits.  This means that it is more beneficial to gift it onwards.  Conversely, in an exchange economy, the same good could have *exchange>cost>use* for an individual, meaning they would be encouraged to hoard it as long as the potential exchange-value continued to stay above the cost-value of storing it.

While we might be used to the idea of hoarding in an exchange economy - and we are motivated to because exchange capacity is a necessity and ensuring for the future is prudent - hoarding would generally be a cost in a non-reciprocal gifting economy, and hoarding is anyway unnecessary for the receipt of future goods.  The motivation for individual hoarding would be reduced and it is possible that we would see less not just of hoarding but of the desire for it as well.

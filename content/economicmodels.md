## Types of transfers and economic models

One way to conceive of different economic activities is to consider them as transfers of resources that include at least one voluntary party.  This can provide a little insight into the different ways that various economic models work.


### Unidirectional transfers

Economic transfers create interconnected economic networks, such as markets, and are the primary study of economics.  I’ll place them into two categories: unidirectional and bidirectional.  In a unidirectional transfer, resources are transferred from one actor to another.  There are three possibilities:

|  | Source | Recipient |
|-- | --| --|
| Gift | *voluntary* | *voluntary* |
| Requisition | *involuntary* | *voluntary* | 
| Burden | *voluntary* | *involuntary* |

The non-reciprocal gift is a transfer that the source agrees to give and the recipient agrees to receive - without the consent of both, the transfer is not accomplished.  Charity, some forms of welfare, and volunteering are all forms of non-reciprocal gifting.

The requisition, in comparison, is when the source has the resources transferred away from them at the choosing of the recipient.  For example, a tax will transfer money from the source (the taxpayer) to the recipient (the government) without a specific reciprocation and without the consent of the taxpayer.  (This is not a discussion on the morality of taxation, but a classification of the type of transfer that it is - distinct from the gift and the exchange, for example.)

The burden is when one actor transfers resources to another actor who may not wish to receive them, such as the classic white elephant.  There then may be a cost or obligation that is associated with storing or removing the resources if they are not wanted.

### Bidirectional transfers

The next types of transfers are bidirectional.  These are effectively two unidirectional transfers connected by a condition of reciprocation.  Because bidirectional transfers are symmetrical, there are only two primary options:

|  | Actor I | Actor II |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Exchange | *voluntary* | *voluntary* |
| Compensation | *involuntary* | *voluntary* | 

In an exchange, two parties agree to transfer resources voluntarily, based on specific conditions of exchange, while in the compensation, one party chooses the nature of the transfer of resources and the other party does not.

### Pure economic models

Using this classification, it is possible to explore the presence of these transfer-types in economic models.  Some models could be based primarily or entirely on one particular transfer type, while others could be based on a mixture.

*Exchange-only model*

This is the pure market model, where transfer are only conducted through exchanges.  This requires each actor to have sufficient exchange capacity to have resources directed to them, such as money, physical assets, or the capacity to labour.  People who lack this exchange capacity can no longer have resources directed to them in a pure market model, and so their needs would go unsatisfied.  There is a longer discussion of the market-model below when considering mixed models.

Exchanges do perform well at signalling when considering actors who can participate in the market, because both parties need to consent to the exchange, meaning that an unwanted allocation of goods is less likely to occur.  If the economy were a network of nodes (actors) connected by links (exchanges) which resources travelled across, then movement would only occur when both sender and receiver nodes agreed to the transfer, ensuring that resources are directed to where they are wanted.  However, in the exchange-only model, some nodes are unable to link to the network due to insufficient exchange capacity to complete the link.

In the exchange network, the decision of which link to transfer resources down is determined by pricing, with all potential recipients and the source having the capacity to have input (for example, in bidding the recipient nodes can nominate their ceilings and the source can nominate their floor).

*Gift-only model*

This model functions purely on voluntary, non-reciprocal gifting.  This model does not exclude actors due to conditions such as lacking money, assets or the ability to labour, because it does not require that actors have any particular participation in the market in order to have resources allocated to them.

Like the exchange, non-reciprocal gifting requires voluntarily agreement from both actors, which increases signalling performance.  The network of nodes will create links whenever an actor is willing and able to conduct a transfer and a recipient is willing and able to accept it, ensuring that resources are not allocated in an unwanted fashion.  However, unlike the exchange network, all nodes are theoretically able to connect.

In a gifting network, the decision of which link to send a resource down is up to the source’s determination, either individually, or, more likely, as part of a network of consideration (either through labour empowerment or associative democratic means).

*Requisition-only model*

A requisition-only economic model would be one in which all transfers occur when the recipient takes without consent from the source.  This model seems inherently unstable, because there is no guarantee that requisitioning a resource will allow an actor to complete any process with it (including consuming it) before it is requisitioned by another.  An actor could immediately reverse a requisition, and such a stalemate could then transform the transfers into a type of exchange.

If there were a single requisition authority there would be added stability, but such an authority would have to consume all the resources if there were no other way to transfer them.

*Burden-only model*

The burden-only model is a little more stable, because an actor can keep resources for as long as they desire to ensure they complete any process with them, and then transfer resources when it is applicable for them.  Theoretically, a network of burden transfers could operate to allocate resources.

The issue with a burden-only model is likely signalling: while the source can voluntarily determine when is appropriate, the recipient has less power to do so.  This means that actors can reduce their own costs by burdening others without regard to whether the burden is a benefit to the recipient, leading to unwanted allocation.  The result could be a chain-reaction in which unwanted resources are continually re-burdened.  If re-burdened back to the original source, the resulting stalemate might approach a gifting model, where resources are only transferred at the voluntarily request of both actors.

*Compensation-only model*

The compensation-only model would mimic the exchange-only model, in that the network would consist of bidirectional transfers.  However, the transfers only require the  consent of one actor, the agent, and not the consent of the other, the patient.  At one extreme, when the agent considers the patient’s wants, this would function more like an exchange, and at the other end, where the agent does not consider the patient, it behaves more like a requisition.

If actors can immediately reverse the compensation with a transfer of their own, then the system would be inherently unstable, and would have to decay into a system of either exchanges (where the reversal behaves as a type of voluntary rejection of the compensation and thus transforms it into an exchange) or requisitions (which could themselves decay into exchanges).

Thus, exchanges and gifting are the most stable bases for a single-type model.

Interestingly, this analysis suggests that there are two “families” of transfers: the *gift-family*, and the *exchange-family*.  The gift-family is a spectrum with the gift at one end and the burden at the other, and the exchange-family is a spectrum with the exchange at one end and requisition at the other, with compensation falling in-between.  The gift and exchange ends occur when power is distributed, and the burden and requisition ends occur when there is a power inequality between two classes of actors.

### Mixed models

Mixed-transfer models could use two or more transfer-types to offset the instabilities in each type.  The main types I want to consider here are the requisition-based mixed models, and the exchange-based mixed models, often associated with command economies and market economies.

*Requisition-based models*

Requisition-based models are unstable if a requisition can be immediately reversed or immediately re-requisitioned, so a stabilising structure would be to have a class of actors who are the only ones who can perform requisitions (the recipient-class), and a class of actors who are the only ones who can have their resources requisitioned (the source-class).  (You could extend this to multiple tiers where each tier can requisition one or more tiers below, but I will leave that unexplored here.)

Within a class, if further transfers are to take place (“horizontally”), they must take place through a transfer that is not a requisition, such as burdening, gifting, compensating or exchanging.  But if the requisition is the primary type of transfer, then other transfers within classes would be limited.  This suggests an economic model where one class produces resources that are then requisitioned to another class (“vertically”).

A variation on this model would be where the recipient-class vertically transfers a lot of the resources back, through gifting or burdening.  The first of these would be a redistributive model, where resources are taken from production and then re-allocated according to some metric (for example, need) regardless of the recipient’s participation in production.  The second would be a command economy model, where the resources of production are requisitioned by one authority and then distributed according to the will of that authority (regardless of its institutional type).

Exchanges and compensation are other alternatives to gifting or burdening, but these require that the producer-class retain sufficient resources that were not or could not be requisitioned.  The most likely of these is labour, which cannot be requisitioned without physical force, but could be coerced into performing work through exchanges or compensations by a class that retains the necessary resources for survival.  This description is more reminiscent of oppressive serf and slave models.  However, if producers retain more of their resources, then exchanges and compensation could be more flexible.

*Exchange-based models*

The pure exchange model is that of transfers only occurring through exchanges, though this leaves some actors - those without sufficient exchange capacity - disconnected from the network of resource transfers.  To facilitate transfers of resources to these actors, gifting could be applied.  This is one of the traditional models, where, for example, men went and worked and received pay, and gifted (or burdened) resources to their family (spouse, children, even parents).

In this type of model, actors are often also gifting resources - predominantly labour - to support the producers or production, such as unpaid care work, volunteering, and unpaid overtime at places of employment.

For those actors who do not have family support, extended community support, such as through mutual aid or charity, can ensure that they receive necessary resources.

In an exchange-based economy, gifting is a critical way in which to ensure actors without exchange capacity are connected to the network and provided with resources.

Increasingly the government has played a role in this aspect, taking money in through requisition and gifting resources out through welfare, grants and public services, or sometimes through exchanges, such as paid services or mutual obligation welfare.  Similar to the requisition-based model, the government is the only actor that can use requisition.  The distinction between a requisition-based model and this exchange-based model is the emphasis on either vertical transfers (requisitions and gifting) or horizontal transfers (exchanges and gifting), which suggests both that there is a midpoint where the two transfer-types are balanced in a mixed model, and that one type can transfer to the other.

*Compensation-based models*

Given that compensation can fluctuate between exchanges and requisition, and that exchange-based models and requisition-based models occupy a spectrum, the compensation-based model is effectively an extra dimension on that spectrum.  Here there would be a class that can perform compensations upon another class, which needs to have some exchange capacity in order to complete the compensation.  Thus, the producer class would have their resources compulsorily acquired with, for example, credit given in compensation, and could then purchase goods at set prices from the recipient-class.  This is somewhat similar to the company scrip-model, where employment opportunities are limited, the company owns the output and tools, the monopoly on employment means that the wages can be fixed by the company, and the monopoly on sales in a company town means that the company can also fix the prices, with little to no negotiation or competition possible.  However, horizontal transfers of various sorts are still available.

*Gift-based models*

Non-reciprocal gifting is present in a variety of the mixed models presented above.  However, a model based primarily on non-reciprocal gifting does not exclude any actor from the network and, unlike the requisition model, does not require a second type of transfer to enable resources to move from any one node to any other node.  Thus, while a gift-based model could be supplemented by another transfer type, it is not necessary for the performance of the model.  In effect, all transfers can be done “horizontally” by the one method of transfer.

### Are some models more preferable?

There is a wealth of discussion regarding command economies, redistributive economies (which are sometimes considered together without distinction), and market models, with a distinction often made between what we might call horizontal market models (though with exchanges and gifting) and vertical models (which also include requisition and a requisition authority).  Pure gift economies have some discussion in mostly anarchist thought (as they do not require any verticality).

Anarchists in general dislike vertical models and propose horizontal models - the horizontal market model for anarcho-capitalists and the gift model for anarchists.

There is some suspicion of vertical models because of the possibility of moving from a model one group finds favourable - for example, Austrian economists and laissez-faire market supporters might believe that a vertical market model could transform into a redistributive or command model, while socialist supporters of a redistributive model might worry that it could become a command or company scrip model.  The pure exchange model also potentially suffers from stability issues, because the network incompleteness, where some nodes are left disconnected, places pressure on the model to adapt to gifting or increasing verticality.

Those who prioritise liberty would prefer models with voluntary-voluntary transfers, such as exchanges and gifting, rather than transfers with an involuntary component, such as burdening, requisitioning or compensating.  Thus, horizontal market or pure gift models would be preferable.  Similarly, those who advocate for dispersed and local knowledge would want to avoid verticality and aim for voluntary-voluntary transfers where each party is a full decision-maker, and would prefer the same models.  The horizontal market model, however, is questionable here, because it has typically shown itself to prioritise one type of information (exchange signalling) over another (gift signalling).

If the focus is on ensuring that needs are met, models with full network inclusion would be preferred.  The only model that inherently fails this test is the pure exchange model, whereas vertical models have the opportunity to connect nodes to the network through gifting or burdening via vertical transfers.  The pure gifting model also ensures that no nodes are left unconnected.

A common priority is private property, which is found under the exchange-based and gift-based models, while an alternative priority is common ownership, perhaps found under the redistributive model (on the assumption that the requisition authority is democratically run).

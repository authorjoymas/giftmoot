# Giftmoot membership

## Who can join a giftmoot?

Giftmoots are the coordinating associations within a giftmoot economy, and that means they are central to the distribution of both essential and specialist goods.  Giftmoots operate democratically, but they are also private, voluntary organisations.  They may have a general focus, where they coordinate and distribute a range of common goods, or a specialist focus, such as an industry body that deliberates on industry standards, and education-to-industry pathways.  They may even have a focus on minority rights and needs, or specialised care for people in certain contexts.

Following the democratic principle, as well as the concept of a free "market" of giftmoots, members should be able to move freely from giftmoot to giftmoot as they desire, moving away from giftmoots whose reputations or allocation provisions they disagree with, and towards trustworthy giftmoots whose allocation principles they align with.  Without this free movement, the competition between giftmoots would be minimised, and the pressures on giftmoots to provide fair allocation outcomes would erode.  This is somewhat similar to the equilibrium of the free market.

Conversely, however, specialised giftmoots may suffer if they cannot apply membership conditions.  A giftmoot specialising in medicine provisions may want to ensure its members are qualified in the industry, while a giftmoot that focuses on catering to specific needs may function best when it is composed of people who are educated on or have lived experience of those needs.

These tensions can be resolved with the implementation of three basic rules regarding giftmoot membership:

## If a giftmoot distributes goods to members, it must have open membership

For an equilibrium to form between giftmoots, there must be open membership for giftmoots that distribute goods.  This prevents a giftmoot with exclusive membership from hoarding goods for themselves, and reinforces that the principle of democratic giftmoot rights applies generally rather than specifically.

This would ensure that where two giftmoots have different allocation priorities, members can freely choose between them, and that if a giftmoot is itself over-allocated, there is pressure to move that excess allocation on rather than to retain it.  [There is some more detail on this in the post on giftmoot equilibrium](https://old.reddit.com/r/giftmoot/comments/1imqrcj/giftmoots_and_economic_equilibrium/).

## A giftmoot with exclusive membership cannot allocate goods to members

Any giftmoot can have exclusive membership, where the membership rules are decided by and enforced by the giftmoot, based on factors such as expertise or lived experience.  However, if a giftmoot wishes to exercise exclusivity of membership, it should not be able to allocate resources to those members.

The function of this rule is to prevent giftmoots hoarding allocations for select in-group crowds.  A steel industry body may wish to only include in its membership people with steel-industry expertise and experience, in order that the decision-making about the investments of the giftmoot are aligned with that expertise.

Exclusive giftmoots would then largely be coordinating bodies that connect gift-givers with recipients but do not themselves handle or distribute the goods to their members.  Their roles would largely be logistic and advisory.

For example, a giftmoot may form whose membership is exclusive and relates to professionals in a particular area of medicine, in order to make informed advisory decisions regarding certain types of medical care.  The inclusion of non-experts on the board might affect the decision-making outcomes and compromise the integrity of the decisions that are made.  Such a giftmoot may be gifted quantities of medicine and make allocation decisions regarding its most appropriate use.  However, the giftmoot would not be able to distribute the medicine to its members or their businesses.  Instead, the giftmoot could distribute the medicine to other, non-exclusive giftmoots, on the basis that they trust and have advised upon the use of the medicine with that recipient giftmoot.

The recipient giftmoot would, if it distributes to its members, have open-membership.  Therefore the recipient cannot simply be a channel for the distributor to distribute to its own members, because other members could join.

## Individuals should select a single, primary giftmoot

Where giftmoots offer different types of goods and services, individuals should be allowed to obtain membership of as many as they see fit in order to benefit from the variety of services on offer.

However, the potential for "double-dipping" - obtaining the same sets of resources from multiple giftmoots by maintaining membership with all of them - could negatively affect the distribution of resources in a manner that is equitable within and between giftmoots.

Instead, individuals should be able to register one giftmoot as their "primary" giftmoot, where other giftmoots can check members against the registry.  Individuals could change the registration regularly, though not so often as to abuse it.

This would allow giftmoots to make allocation decisions that affect primary members and then further decisions that affect secondary members.  For example, the giftmoot might vote to distribute those essential resources that are in abundance to all members, but those resources that are scarce to primary members only, preventing people from double-dipping by drawing the same scarce resources from multiple giftmoots.

This would allow giftmoot decision-making regarding the use of scarce resources to be meaningfully equitable - that is, if the giftmoot determines that a only certain measure of scarce resources should go to each member, then this isn't violated if another member gains more from another giftmoot.  This also protects other giftmoots in the same manner.

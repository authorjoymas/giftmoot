## Allocation methods

The primary way of allocating goods in a giftmoot economy is through a potential recipient making a request and a gift-giver fulfilling that request.  This would usually be facilitated by the financial institutions of the giftmoot economy - giftmoots themselves.  These private and voluntary institutions create allocation rules through democratic processes.

Giftmoots might act as facilitators of rights, ensuring that members get their required allocation, or as discerning investors who provide resources to actors based on business plans or other comprehensive proposals.

However, there are also a variety of other ways in which giftmoots and producers can allocate resources:

### First come, first served

A classic way to allocate resources is to allocate them to people in the order in which they arrive.  This is a common approach in an exchange economy, and occurs if a price is fixed.  For example, for any product there will be a set of buyers who have the desire and exchange capacity to obtain the product; if this number of people is too high, the price may increase until the people who are willing to spend that amount of their exchange capacity is reduced to roughly the amount of product available - that is, price rises until demand reduces to the amount of supply.  However, for events like concerts there may still be more people willing to pay than tickets available.  When this occurs, one common strategy is to simply allocate tickets on a first-come, first-served basis.  This can result in people waiting in virtual queues for ticket sales to open.  Similarly, lines for new technology such as the iPhone exist because the price is fixed but the supply is limited, and those first in line will receive stock first.

Given that this is a staple in the exchange economy, it would be easily transferred to the giftmoot economy, with the extra stipulation of being able to meet the price-point removed.  Other stipulations from the exchange economy, such as limiting the amount of product that any one recipient can obtain, could be retained, however.

### Lottery

Another common procedure in an exchange economy is that of the lottery - where, for example, ticket concerts or access to events may be assigned randomly where demand significantly outstrips supply.

This procedure would also easily apply to goods with constrained supply in a giftmoot economy.

### Cake-cutting algorithms

A fair cake-cutting algortithm is one that divides up a good (often a finite, fungible and continuous good - but not always) amongst a group of people in a manner that, regardless of their differing perceptions of value, each participant considers fair.

Cake-cutting algorithms are often multi-stage processes and can be computationally arduous, but have been used successfully to produce satisfactory outcomes in regards to the allocation of goods in a will or disputed land.

To further resource allocation in a giftmoot economy a further investigation of practical types of cake-cutting would be beneficial.

### Bidding

Bidding is usually associated with money as participants bid differing amounts of money in order to obtain a certain good.  However, even in a non-monetary economy there are factors that would allow for bidding on resources that may be able to allocate them rationally.

For example, a bid could include consideration of both time and priority - a bidder would determine what priority they believed this good held for them, as well as how long they are willing to wait to receive it.  There is a wide variety of potential evaluations: a bidder may definitely want to receive the good and be willing to wait almost any amount of time, or want the good now or never, going to find an alternative if they do not receive the good within a short timeframe.

With these factors, it would be possible to create a bidding game where each actor is allocated a set number of bidding points which they can place on amounts of goods and dates, placing all of their bidding points on an early date (the "now or never" scenario) or spreading them out more liberally (the "must have at some point" scenario) or somewhere in between.  Higher bids would win, and losing bids would roll over to (if possible) the next-best bid by the same bidder.

This would allow for a rational allocation related to timing and priority without the need to depend on an actor's capacity to accrue exchange capacity.

### Allocation is flexible

There are a variety of ways to allocate resources - democratically, mathematically, through bidding, lottery or timing - that do not involve those with greater wealth gaining priority by default.  With such an array of tools - including, presumably, several that are not mentioned here - a giftmoot economy could flexibly respond to different types of demand situation.
